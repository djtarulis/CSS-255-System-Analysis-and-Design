    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a test on our ability to recognize and create system designs and requirements. The client, DriverPass, was a company that wanted to create an online platform to help with the training and education of student drivers.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
In the DriverPass project I did a great job of understanding what a client wants when explaining their idea of a system. A client may not know exactly what they want an I know that I would be able to bridge the gaps and help the client find what they are looking. 
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise these documents I would go back and re-do the system requirements. I don't know much about networking or the benefits of certain hardware. Looking into that more would further improve the design of the system.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The functionality of the system to the user is one of the most important parts of the system. When designing the system I took the most important parts of what the client needed and the most important parts of what a typical user would need and prioritized them first.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When approaching software design, it is best for me to look at it from the widest angle I can. Start with the scope and general concepts first. Then work towards client requirements and system requirements. Referencing back to these design documents in the future will be a big help in designing a system again. Other tools I could use include the various UML diagrams as well as Gantt charts when further in the design process.
